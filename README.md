# UselessCrap Token (CRAP)

ERC20 Test token on Ethereum blockchain leverages chainlink (LINK) price oracle and the new chainlink VRF to get random verified numbers.

This token rebalances every hour and affect tokens that are locked on the contract.
When rebalance mechanism activates:
* Requests a random number to be generated by the chainlink VRF
* When the random number arrives get the current price of BTC/ETH pair using chainlink price oracle
* If new price is greater than the price at the previous rebalance: Mint random % of tokens for each account that have locked tokens. 
* If new price is less than the price at the previous rebalance: Burn random % of tokens on each account that have locked tokens.
